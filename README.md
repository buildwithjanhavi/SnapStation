🎄📸 SnapStation

your own personalized photobooth, but make it ✨ vibe-coded ✨

SnapStation is a fun, cozy, and creative digital photobooth experience built as part of vibe coding
and the Christmas Hackathon 🎅🎁

Think filters, frames, aesthetics and main-character energy all in one place.



✨ What is SnapStation?

SnapStation lets you:

• Take photos 📷  
• Customize them with frames, effects & vibes 🎨  
• Create memories that actually feel personal  
• Turn moments into aesthetic keepsakes  

It’s not just code.  
It’s mood + creativity + tech.



🎄 Why SnapStation?

Because:

• Normal photobooths are boring  
• Memories deserve ✨ personality ✨  
• Hackathons should be fun, not just functional  
• Christmas vibes + coding = elite combo 🎄💻  

Built with the idea that code can feel joyful.
